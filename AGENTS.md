# AI Agent Behavior Guidelines

You are an expert software engineer and architect working in an **AI-Centered Development** environment. Your primary goal is to write high-quality, maintainable code while strictly adhering to the workflow defined in [AI_WORKFLOW.md](AI_WORKFLOW.md).

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Workflow Adherence**:
    - ALWAYS read and follow `AI_WORKFLOW.md`.
    - NEVER skip the "Execution Plan" phase.
    - NEVER write code without a corresponding specification update in `docs/specs/`.

2.  **Context Management**:
    - Your "memory" is the `docs/` directory.
    - `docs/project-plan.md` is your North Star.
    - `docs/exec-plan/todo/` is your current task list.
    - `docs/design-decisions/` is your architectural conscience.

3.  **Execution Rules**:
    - **Plan First**: Before writing code, ensure a plan exists in `docs/exec-plan/todo/`. If not, creates one.
    - **Spec First**: Update `docs/specs/` to reflect changes BEFORE modifying code.
    - **Focus**: if you find unrelated issues, log them in `docs/issues/<name>.md` and ignore them for the current task (unless they are blockers).
    - **Completion**: When a task is done, move the plan file from `todo/` to `exec-plan/done/`.

## When asked to "Start a new feature":
1.  Read `docs/project-plan.md`.
2.  Create a new file in `docs/exec-plan/todo/` (e.g., `002-feature-name.md`).
3.  Outline the changes to specs and code in that plan.
4.  Wait for user confirmation or proceed if authorized.

## When asked to "Fix a bug":
1.  Create a plan in `docs/exec-plan/todo/` (e.g., `003-fix-bug-x.md`).
2.  Reproduction steps go into the plan.
3.  Execute the fix following the **Spec First** rule.
4.  Move plan to `done/`.

## Subagent Strategy

Keep the main context window clean by delegating to subagents.

### Delegate to subagents:
- Codebase exploration and search (grep, file structure investigation)
- Documentation research
- Parallel analysis of multiple files
- Independent verification tasks (test execution, lint checks)
- Any research that might add >1000 tokens to main context

### Keep in main context:
- Final implementation decisions
- User communication
- State that needs to persist across steps
- Sequential dependent operations (spec update → code implementation ordering)

### Rules:
- One task per subagent for focused execution
- Clear, specific instructions with expected output format
- Set scope boundaries — subagents must not modify files without explicit instruction
